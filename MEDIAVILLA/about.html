                                    <p>Welcome, my guests!  I am Mark Andrei T. Mediavilla, a first year
                                        BS Information Technology student of Our Lady of Fatima University 
                                        (OLFU)-Antipolo<br>Campus.  This is my startup website wherein I tried to 
                                        apply what I learned from my subject Web Dev Design.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    This website is all about my passion for travelling, videography, and most of all train 
                                    driving thru train simulation.  I love travelling to different places to<br>see the beauty 
                                    around them.  For the past years, I've been to differentplaces in Luzon and Visayas,
                                    discovering the tourist attractions everyone is talking about and familiarizing with the
                                    directions on how to get there.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    There is one point in time during my high school days wherein I tried to document my
                                    provincial trip and shared it with social media.  Unexpectedly, a<br>lot of people views the
                                    said clippings which gave me an idea that there are lots of people interested in road trips. 
                                    This incident inspired me to video<br>cover my succeeding road trips and share some of it in
                                    social media.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    My love for train driving can be considered as my first love because I am interested in every aspect
                                    of railway operations since childhood. I am<br>fascinated playing Thomas & Friends during my childhood
                                    days until I discover the train simulation game especially in European countries which I<br>play until now. I also
                                    learn to use some of the accessories in train simulation to make my own customed route.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Further, this website will share video coverage of some northern provincial trips to update the viewers
                                    of the current directions and what to expect<br>during road trips, and hopeful to cover other parts of the
                                    country in the near future.  My train simulation in European countries will provide the viewers<br>with the
                                    location of actual train stations and how does the sceneries will look like.  The viewers can download the
                                    videos and share with others but<br>please acknowledge.
